The project contains two parts
1. Dashboard
2. Python Notebook for Decision Tree and Knowledge base text.

For the Dashboard

1. There is a requirements.txt file.
2. Install the requirements mentioned in requirements.txt.
3. Open app.py in VS Code
4. In the terminal navigate to the location and type 'streamlit run app.py'

Description of Dashboard

The dashboard gives the data description and analysis of various parameters. It has analysis of priority of issues against the type of applications.
The dashboard will also give predictive analysis of future events and p value against the issues that happened in previous two months.
The dashboard also gives the analysis of name of applications most frequently occurred and there is a plan to introduce location wise analysis in future


For Process Flowchart creation

1. Run all cells in the notebook.

Remarks:
Idea: #these were not implemented due to shortage of time 
The webapp includes a second page where the open incidents can be viewed and interracted with. 
This page would include a view of the current process tree with thickness of the directed arrows indicating the frequency of that path.
Important feature would be a worknotes editor for the IT personel to work on the incident.
It would have a chat-box style interface with prompter to control the language entered in the worknotes.
 --- this is necessary for accurate clustering of worknotes.
 Our proposal is to implement this system as a new way of worknotes maintainence which aids in process extraction.  

demoData.xlsx is essential for generating the flow chart. --> the worknotes are eddited slightly as per prompt idea.
in essence the starting of the notes are prompted : Ask if, Request info, Remark an such.
